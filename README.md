# Sector Rotation Strategy with Risk-Based Portfolio Construction

This project implements a multi-factor sector rotation strategy with sophisticated risk management.
The strategy allocates capital across U.S. equity sectors based on a combination of:
1. Macroeconomic regime indicators
2. Technical momentum signals
3. Relative value metrics
4. Risk-based portfolio construction

The implementation includes realistic transaction costs, proper risk decomposition,
and adaptive position sizing based on volatility regimes.

## Main Features:
- Factor-based sector selection
- Risk-based portfolio construction
- Volatility targeting
- Transaction cost modeling
- Performance attribution (factor vs. idiosyncratic)
- Realistic backtesting with proper constraints
